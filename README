-------------------------------------------------

Description
-----------
  LCOV is an extension of GCOV, a GNU tool which provides information about
  what parts of a program are actually executed (i.e. "covered") while running
  a particular test case. The extension consists of a set of Perl scripts
  which build on the textual GCOV output to implement the following enhanced
  functionality:

    * HTML based output: coverage rates are additionally indicated using bar
      graphs and specific colors.

    * Support for large projects: overview pages allow quick browsing of
      coverage data by providing either a hierarchical directory structure
      view or a three-level detail view: directory, file and source code view.

  LCOV was initially designed to support Linux kernel coverage measurements,
  but works as well for coverage measurements on standard user space
  applications.

  LCOV has recently been enhanced to support differential coverage, as well
  as date- and owner-binning.  See https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07947 or https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9438597 for 
  a detailed explanation of the concepts and several possible use models.
  A video presentation of the basic ideas can be found at http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4653252

  In addition, several other features and capabilities have been added.  See section 5, below, for a brief description - and also see the man pages and the test cases.

2. Installing LCOV
------------------
The LCOV package is available as either RPM or tarball from:
     
  https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov/releases

To install the tarball, unpack it to a directory and run:

  make install

Use Git for the most recent (but possibly unstable) version:

  git clone https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov.git

Change to the resulting lcov directory and type:

  make install


3. An example of how to access Linux kernel coverage data
---------------------------------------------------------
Requirements: Follow the Linux kernel coverage setup instructions at:

  https://docs.kernel.org/dev-tools/gcov.html

As root, do the following:

  a) Resetting counters

     lcov --zerocounters

  b) Capturing the current coverage state to a file

     lcov --capture --output-file kernel.info

  c) Getting HTML output

     genhtml kernel.info

Point the web browser of your choice to the resulting index.html file.


4. An example of how to access coverage data for a user space program
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements: compile the program in question using GCC with the options
-fprofile-arcs and -ftest-coverage. During linking, make sure to specify
-lgcov or -coverage.

Assuming the compile directory is called "appdir", do the following:

  a) Resetting counters

     lcov --directory appdir --zerocounters

  b) Capturing the current coverage state to a file

     lcov --directory appdir --capture --output-file app.info

     Note that this step only works after the application has
     been started and stopped at least once. Otherwise lcov will
     abort with an error mentioning that there are no data/.gcda files.

  c) Getting HTML output

     genhtml app.info

  d) Generating a differential coverage report

     See the examples in .../tests/gendiffcov.

Point the web browser of your choice to the resulting index.html file.

Please note that independently of where the application is installed or
from which directory it is run, the --directory statement needs to
point to the directory in which the application was compiled.

For further information on the gcc profiling mechanism, please also
consult the gcov man page.


5. New features (compared to lcov 1.16):

New features and capabilities fall into 6 major categories:

  a) Categorization

     This refers primarily to differentical coverage categorization as
     well as date- and owner-binning.  See https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07947
     or https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9438597 for a detailed
     description of the concepts.

     Differential categorization and binning are orthogonal in the sense
     that you can generate differential report without binning as well
     as 'vanilla' coverage reports with binning.  See the above papers
     and the genhtml man page for details.

     Related options:
        --baseline-file, --diff-file, --annotate-script, --date-bins,
        --new-file-as-baseline, --elide-path-mismtach

  b) Error handling

     A generic - but very simple - error handler has been added to the
     lcov tool suite.  The error handler is used to report exceptions,
     and provides a mechanism for the user to ignore the particular
     message if desired.
     See the genhtml/lcov/geninfo man pages for details.

     Note that some errors are unrecoverable - and cannot be suppressed or
     ignored.

     Related options:  --ignore-error, --keep-going

  c) Navigation and display:

     Navigation aids such as hyperlinks to the first uncovered region,
     to the next uncovered region, etc. have been implemented.  Similarly,
     new tables, new columns, and new links between tables enable the
     user to identify the author of particular code (covered or not
     covered), as well as the time period when the code was written.

     Collectively, these features help the user to quickly identify the
     cause of code coverage issues, and to then decide what to do.

     An option to generate a 'hierarchical' coverage report (which follows
     the source code directory struture) as well as varioiu other small
     features (tooltip popups, user-specified HTML header, footer, and
     table labels, etc.) are also available.

     See the genhtml man page for some details, as well as the
     'gendiffcov/simple' testcases for some examples.

      Related options:
          --baseline-title, --baseline-date, --current-date, --hierarchical,
          --show-owners, --show-noncode, --show-navigation

  d) Data manipulation

     Filters are used to suppress or remove certain coverage artifacts -
     for example, branches generated by the compiler (e.g., for exception
     handling).  These artifacts can overwhelm the user code and obscure
     coverage features that are interesting to the user.

     Other options are used to focus on or to exclude certain sections
     of code, as well as to do regexp replacement of file names.
     (Path munging is useful primarily when the build structure does
     not exactly match the layout in your revision control system; this
     is common in large projects with reusable components.)

     See the lcov/geninfo/genhtml man pages for a detailed description of
     the available filters and manipulation features.

     Related options:
        --include, --exclude, --omit-lines, --substitute, --filter

  e) Callbacks/customization

     The user can supply callbacks which are used to:

        i) interface with the revision control system
        ii) verify that source code versions are compatible, and
        iii) enforce a desired code coverage criteria

     See the genhtml/lcov/geninfo man pages for details.

     Related options:
       --annotate-script, --criteria-script, --version-script

  f) Performance

     lcov/genhtml/geninfo have been refactored to parallelize computation
     across multiple cores, if requested.
     In general, this provides speedup that is nearly linear in the number
     of cores.
     There is also an option to throttle parallelism to not exceed peak
     memory consumption contraints.

     See the genhtml/lcov/geninfo man pages for details

     Related options: --parallel, --memory, --profile

In general, the new features and options are implemented uniformly in lcov,
genhtml, and geninfo.  Most of the features can be enabled/disabled
using either command line options or by setting defaults in your 'lcovrc'
file.  See the lcovrc man page for details.
