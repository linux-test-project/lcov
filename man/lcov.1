.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lcov
is a graphical front\-end for GCC's coverage testing tool gcov. It collects
line, function and branch coverage data for multiple source files and creates
HTML pages containing the source code annotated with coverage information.
It also adds overview pages for easy navigation within the file structure.

Use
.B lcov
to collect coverage data and
.B genhtml
to create HTML pages. Coverage data can either be collected from the
currently running Linux kernel or from a user space application. To do this,
you have to complete the following preparation steps:

For Linux kernel coverage:
.RS
Follow the setup instructions for the gcov\-kernel infrastructure:
.I https://docs.kernel.org/dev-tools/gcov.html
.br


For user space application coverage:
.RS 3
Compile the application with GCC using the options
"\-fprofile\-arcs" and "\-ftest\-coverage" or "\-\-coverage".
.RE

Please note that this man page refers to the output format of
.B lcov
as ".info file" or "tracefile" and that the output of GCOV
is called ".da file".

Also note that when printing percentages, 0% and 100% are only printed when
the values are exactly 0% and 100% respectively. Other values which would
conventionally be rounded to 0% or 100% are instead printed as nearest
non-boundary value. This behavior is in accordance with that of the
.BR gcov (1)
tool.

.SH OPTIONS


.B \-a
.I tracefile_pattern
.br
.B \-\-add\-tracefile
.I tracefile_pattern
.br
.RS
Add contents of all files matching glob pattern
.IR trcefile_pattern.

Specify several tracefiles using the \-a switch to combine the coverage data
contained in these files by adding up execution counts for matching test and
filename combinations.

The result of the add operation will be written to stdout or the tracefile
specified with \-o.

Only one of  \-z, \-c, \-a, \-e, \-r, \-l, \-\-diff or \-\-summary may be
specified at a time.

.RE

.B \-b
.I directory
.br
.B \-\-base\-directory
.I directory
.br
.RS
.RI "Use " directory
as base directory for relative paths.

Use this option to specify the base directory of a build\-environment
when lcov produces error messages like:

.RS
ERROR: could not read source file /home/user/project/subdir1/subdir2/subdir1/subdir2/file.c
.RE

In this example, use /home/user/project as base directory.

This option is required when using lcov on projects built with libtool or
similar build environments that work with a base directory, i.e. environments,
where the current working directory when invoking the compiler is not the same
directory in which the source code file is located.

Note that this option will not work in environments where multiple base
directories are used. In that case use configuration file setting
.B geninfo_auto_base=1
(see
.BR lcovrc (5)).
.RE

.B \-c
.br
.B \-\-capture
.br
.RS
Capture coverage data.

By default captures the current kernel execution counts and writes the
resulting coverage data to the standard output. Use the \-\-directory
option to capture counts for a user space program.

The result of the capture operation will be written to stdout or the tracefile
specified with \-o.

Only one of  \-z, \-c, \-a, \-e, \-r, \-l, \-\-diff or \-\-summary may be
specified at a time.
.RE

.B \-\-branch\-coverage
.br
Collect and/or retain branch coverage data.

This is equivalent to using the option "\-\-rc lcov_branch_coverage=1"; the option was added to better match the genhml interface.

.RE

.B \-\-checksum
.br
.B \-\-no\-checksum
.br
.RS
Specify whether to generate checksum data when writing tracefiles.

Use \-\-checksum to enable checksum generation or \-\-no\-checksum to
disable it. Checksum generation is
.B disabled
by default.

When checksum generation is enabled, a checksum will be generated for each
source code line and stored along with the coverage data. This checksum will
be used to prevent attempts to combine coverage data from different source
code versions.

If you don't work with different source code versions, disable this option
to speed up coverage data processing and to reduce the size of tracefiles.
.RE

.B \-\-compat
.IR mode = value [, mode = value ,...]
.br
.RS
Set compatibility mode.

Use \-\-compat to specify that lcov should enable one or more compatibility
modes when capturing coverage data. You can provide a comma-separated list
of mode=value pairs to specify the values for multiple modes.

Valid
.I values
are:

.B on
.RS
Enable compatibility mode.
.RE
.B off
.RS
Disable compatibility mode.
.RE
.B auto
.RS
Apply auto-detection to determine if compatibility mode is required. Note that
auto-detection is not available for all compatibility modes.
.RE

If no value is specified, 'on' is assumed as default value.

Valid
.I modes
are:

.B libtool
.RS
Enable this mode if you are capturing coverage data for a project that
was built using the libtool mechanism. See also
\-\-compat\-libtool.

The default value for this setting is 'on'.

.RE
.B hammer
.RS
Enable this mode if you are capturing coverage data for a project that
was built using a version of GCC 3.3 that contains a modification
(hammer patch) of later GCC versions. You can identify a modified GCC 3.3
by checking the build directory of your project for files ending in the
extension '.bbg'. Unmodified versions of GCC 3.3 name these files '.bb'.

The default value for this setting is 'auto'.

.RE
.B split_crc
.RS
Enable this mode if you are capturing coverage data for a project that
was built using a version of GCC 4.6 that contains a modification
(split function checksums) of later GCC versions. Typical error messages
when running lcov on coverage data produced by such GCC versions are
\'out of memory' and 'reached unexpected end of file'.

The default value for this setting is 'auto'
.RE

.RE

.B \-\-compat\-libtool
.br
.B \-\-no\-compat\-libtool
.br
.RS
Specify whether to enable libtool compatibility mode.

Use \-\-compat\-libtool to enable libtool compatibility mode or \-\-no\-compat\-libtool
to disable it. The libtool compatibility mode is
.B enabled
by default.

When libtool compatibility mode is enabled, lcov will assume that the source
code relating to a .da file located in a directory named ".libs" can be
found in its parent directory.

If you have directories named ".libs" in your build environment but don't use
libtool, disable this option to prevent problems when capturing coverage data.
.RE

.B \-\-config\-file
.I config\-file
.br
.RS
Specify a configuration file to use.
See the lcovrc man page for details of the file format and options.

When this option is specified, neither the system\-wide configuration file
/etc/lcovrc, nor the per\-user configuration file ~/.lcovrc is read.

This option may be useful when there is a need to run several
instances of
.B lcov
with different configuration file options in parallel.

Note that this option must be specified in full - abbreviations are not supported.

.RE

.B \-\-convert\-filenames
.br
.RS
Convert filenames when applying diff.

Use this option together with \-\-diff to rename the file names of processed
data sets according to the data provided by the diff.
.RE

.B \-\-diff
.I tracefile
.I difffile
.br
.RS
Convert coverage data in
.I tracefile
using source code diff file
.IR difffile .

Use this option if you want to merge coverage data from different source code
levels of a program, e.g. when you have data taken from an older version
and want to combine it with data from a more current version.
.B lcov
will try to map source code lines between those versions and adjust the coverage
data respectively.
.I difffile
needs to be in unified format, i.e. it has to be created using the "\-u" option
of the
.B diff
tool.

Note that lines which are not present in the old version will not be counted
as instrumented, therefore tracefiles resulting from this operation should
not be interpreted individually but together with other tracefiles taken
from the newer version. Also keep in mind that converted coverage data should
only be used for overview purposes as the process itself introduces a loss
of accuracy.

The result of the diff operation will be written to stdout or the tracefile
specified with \-o.

Only one of  \-z, \-c, \-a, \-e, \-r, \-l, \-\-diff or \-\-summary may be
specified at a time.
.RE

.B \-d
.I directory
.br
.B \-\-directory
.I  directory
.br
.RS
Use .da files in
.I directory
instead of kernel.

If you want to work on coverage data for a user space program, use this
option to specify the location where the program was compiled (that's
where the counter files ending with .da will be stored).

Note that you may specify this option more than once.
.RE

.B \-\-exclude
.I pattern
.br
.RS
Exclude source files matching
.IR pattern .

Use this switch if you want to exclude coverage data for a particular set
of source files matching any of the given patterns. Multiple patterns can be
specified by using multiple
.B --exclude
command line switches. The
.I patterns
will be interpreted as shell wildcard patterns (note that they may need to be
escaped accordingly to prevent the shell from expanding them first).

Note: The pattern must be specified to match the
.B absolute
path of each source file.
If you specify a pattern which does not seem to be correctly applied - files that you expected to be excluded still appear in the output - you can look for warning messages in the log file.
.B lcov
will emit a warning for every pattern which is not applied at least once.

Can be combined with the
.B --include
command line switch. If a given file matches both the include pattern and the
exclude pattern, the exclude pattern will take precedence.
.RE

.B \-\-substitute
.I regexp_pattern
.br
.RS
Apply Perl regexp
.IR regexp_pattern
to source file names found during processing.  This is useful when the path name reported by gcov does not match your source layout and the file is not found, or when the paths found in the extracted .info file does not match your source code layout.

Use this option in situations where geninfo cannot find the correct
path to source code files of a project. By providing a
.I regexp_pattern
in Perl regular expression format (see
.BR perlre (1))
, you can instruct geninfo to
remove or change parts of the incorrect source path.

.B Example:
.br

1. When geninfo reports that it cannot find source file
.br

    /path/to/src/.libs/file.c
.br

while the file is actually located in
.br

    /path/to/src/file.c
.br

use the following parameter:
.br

    \-\-substitute 's#/.libs##g'

This will remove all "/.libs" strings from the path.

2. When geninfo reports that it cannot find source file
.br

    /tmp/build/file.c
.br

while the file is actually located in
.br

    /usr/src/file.c
.br

use the following parameter:
.br

    \-\-substitute 's#/tmp/build#/usr/src#g'
.br

This will change all "/tmp/build" strings in the path to "/usr/src".
.PP

.RE

.B \-\-omit\-lines
.I regexp
.br
.RS
Exclude coverage data from lines whose content matches
.IR regexp .

Use this switch if you want to exclude line and branch coverage data for some particular constructs in your code (e.g., some complicated macro).  Multiple patterns can be
specified by using multiple
.B --omit-lines
command line switches. The
.I regexp
will be interpreted as perl regular expressions (note that they may need to be
escaped accordingly to prevent the shell from expanding them first).
If you want the pattern to explicitly match from the start or end of the line, your regexp should start and/or end with "^" and/or "$".

.RE

.B \-\-external
.br
.B \-\-no\-external
.br
.RS
Specify whether to capture coverage data for external source files.

External source files are files which are not located in one of the directories
specified by \-\-directory or \-\-base\-directory. Use \-\-external to include
external source files while capturing coverage data or \-\-no\-external to
ignore this data.

Data for external source files is
.B included
by default.

.RE

.B \-\-prune\-tests
.br
.RS
Specify whether to keep track of testcases which increase code coverage (i.e., by changing at least one 'hit' count from zero to non-zero) or which add at least one coverpoint which has not been seen before.

lcov will emit the list of retained files rather than the test report.

This option has an effect only with \-\-add\-tracefile.

.RE

.B \-\-map\-functions
.br
.RS
Keep track of testcases (trace files) which hit each unique function.

lcov will emit the list of tests for each function, along with the file/line location f the function.

This option has an effect only with \-\-add\-tracefile.

.RE
.B \-\-version\-script
.I script_file
.br
.RS
call script_file to find file ID from revision control when extracting data and to compare version IDs for the purpose of error checking when merging .info files

The script will be called as:
.br
.I script_file source_file_name
;
.br
It should write the version ID to stdout and return a 0 exit status.
If the file has is not versioned, it should write an empty string and return a 0 exit status. See the genhtml man page for more details.

.B
.I script_file source_file_name
.br
It should write the version ID to stdout and return a 0 exit status.
If the file has is not versioned, it should write an empty string and return a 0 exit status, OR

.B
.I script_file \-\-compare source_file_name info_file1_id info_file2_id
.br
It should return non-zero if the IDs do not match.


.RE

.B \-e
.I tracefile
.I pattern
.br
.B \-\-extract
.I tracefile
.I pattern
.br
.RS
Extract data from
.IR tracefile .

Use this switch if you want to extract coverage data for only a particular
set of files from a tracefile. Additional command line parameters will be
interpreted as shell wildcard patterns (note that they may need to be
escaped accordingly to prevent the shell from expanding them first).
Every file entry in
.I tracefile
which matches at least one of those patterns will be extracted.

Note: The pattern must be specified to match the
.B absolute
path of each source file.

The result of the extract operation will be written to stdout or the tracefile
specified with \-o.

Only one of  \-z, \-c, \-a, \-e, \-r, \-l, \-\-diff or \-\-summary may be
specified at a time.
.RE

.B \-f
.br
.B \-\-follow
.br
.RS

.RE

.B \-\-from\-package
.I package
.br
.RS
Use .da files in
.I package
instead of kernel or directory.

Use this option if you have separate machines for build and test and
want to perform the .info file creation on the build machine. See
\-\-to\-package for more information.
.RE

.B \-\-gcov\-tool
.I tool

.RE

.B \-\-include
.I pattern
.br
.RS
Include source files matching
.IR pattern .

Use this switch if you want to include coverage data for only a particular set
of source files matching any of the given patterns. Multiple patterns can be
specified by using multiple
.B --include
command line switches. The
.I patterns
will be interpreted as shell wildcard patterns (note that they may need to be
escaped accordingly to prevent the shell from expanding them first).

Note: The pattern must be specified to match the
.B absolute
path of each source file.
.RE
If you specify a pattern which does not seem to be correctly applied - files that you expected to be included in the output do not appear - lcov will generate an error message of type 'unused'.  See the \-\-ignore\-errors option for how to make lcov ignore the error or turn it into a warning.

.B \-\-ignore\-errors
.I errors
.br
.RS
Specify a list of errors after which to continue processing.

Use this option to specify a list of one or more classes of errors after which
lcov should continue processing instead of aborting.
Note that the tool will generate a warning (rather than a fatal error) unless you ignore the error two (or more) times:
.br
.RS
lcov ... --ignore-errors source,source ...
.RE

.I errors
can be a comma\-separated list of the following keywords:

.B format:
unexpected syntax found in .info file.

.B empty:
the .info data file is empty (e.g., because all the code was 'removed' or excluded.

.B gcov:
the gcov tool returned with a non\-zero return code.

.B source:
the source code file for a data set could not be found.

.B graph:
the graph file could not be found or is corrupted.

.B mismatch:
Inconsistent entries found in trace file:
 - branch expression (3rd field in the .info file 'BRDA' entry) of merge data does not match, or
 - function execution count (FNDA:...) but no function declaration (FN:...).

.B branch:
branch ID (2nd field in the .info file 'BRDA' entry) does not follow expected integer sequence.

.B unused
the include/exclude/omit/substitute pattern did not match any file pathnames.

.B version:
revision control IDs of the file which we are trying to merge are not the same - line numbering and other information may be incorrect.

.B parallel
various types of errors related to parallelism - e.g., child process died due to some error.   If you see an error related to parallel execution, it may be a good idea to remove the \-\-parallel flag and try again.

.B package
a required perl package is not installed on your system.  In some cases, it is possible to ignore this message and continue - however, certain features will be disabled in that case.

.B corrupt
corrupt/unreadable file found.

Capture initial zero coverage data.

Run lcov with \-c and this option on the directories containing .bb, .bbg
or .gcno files before running any test case. The result is a "baseline"
coverage data file that contains zero coverage for every instrumented line.
Combine this data file (using lcov \-a) with coverage data files captured
after a test run to ensure that the percentage of total lines covered is
correct even when not all source code files were loaded during the test.

Recommended procedure when capturing data for a test case:

1. create baseline coverage data file

Messages are sent to stdout unless there is no output file (i.e., if the coverage data is written to stdout rather than to a file) and to stderr otherwise.

.RE
.B \-q
.br
.B \-\-quiet
.RS
Decrement informational message verbosity.

Decreased verbosity will suppres 'progress' messages for example - while error and warning messages will continue to be printed.

.RE
.B \-\-debug
.RS
Increment 'debug messages' verbosity.  This is useful primarily to developers who want to enhance the lcov tool suite.

.BI "\-\-parallel "
.I [ integer ]
.br
.BI "\-j "
.I [ integer ]
.RS
Specify parallelism to use during processing (maximum number of forked child processes).  If the optional integer parallelism parameter is zero or is missing, then use to use up the number of cores on the machine.  Default is not to use a single process (no parallelism).

Currently - parallelism is used with the \-\-add\-tracefile and \-\-capture options.

.RE
.BI "\-\-memory "
.I integer
.RS
Specify the maximum amount of memory to use during prallel processing, in Mb.  Effectively, the process will not fork() if this limit would be exceeded.  Default is 0 (zero) - which means that there is no limit.

This option may be useful if the compute farm environment imposes strict limits on resource utilization such that the job will be killed if it tries to use too many parallel children - but the user does now know a priori what the permissible maximum is.  This option enables the tool to use maximum parallelism - up to the limit imposed by the memory restriction.


.RE

.B \-\-rc
.IR keyword = value
.br
.RS
Override a configuration directive.

Use this option to specify a
.IR keyword = value
statement which overrides the corresponding configuration statement in
the lcovrc configuration file. You can specify this option more than once
to override multiple configuration statements.
See
.BR lcovrc (5)
for a list of available keywords and their meaning.

.B \-r
.I tracefile

.br
.B \-\-remove
.I tracefile
.I pattern
.br
.RS
Remove data from
.IR tracefile .

Use this switch if you want to remove coverage data for a particular
set of files from a tracefile. Additional command line parameters will be
interpreted as shell wildcard patterns (note that they may need to be
escaped accordingly to prevent the shell from expanding them first).
Every file entry in
.I tracefile
which matches at least one of those patterns will be removed.

Note: The pattern must be specified to match the
.B absolute
path of each source file.

The result of the remove operation will be written to stdout or the tracefile
specified with \-o.

Only one of  \-z, \-c, \-a, \-e, \-r, \-l, \-\-diff or \-\-summary may be
specified at a time.
.RE

.B \-\-strip
.I depth
.br
.RS
Strip path components when applying diff.

Use this option together with \-\-diff to tell lcov to disregard the specified
number of initial directories when matching tracefile and diff filenames.
.RE

.B \-\-summary
.I tracefile
.br
.RS
Show summary coverage information for the specified tracefile.

Note that you may specify this option more than once.

Only one of  \-z, \-c, \-a, \-e, \-r, \-l, \-\-diff or \-\-summary may be
specified at a time.
.RE

.B \-\-fail-under-lines
.I percentage
.br
.RS
Use this option together with \-\-summary to tell lcov to exit with a status of 1 if the total
line coverage is less than percentage.
.RE

.B \-t
.I testname
.br
.B \-\-test\-name
.I testname
.br
.RS
Specify test name to be stored in the tracefile.

This name identifies a coverage data set when more than one data set is merged
into a combined tracefile (see option \-a).

Valid test names can consist of letters, decimal digits and the underscore
character ("_").
.RE

.B \-\-to\-package
.I package
.br
.RS
Store .da files for later processing.

Use this option if you have separate machines for build and test and
want to perform the .info file creation on the build machine. To do this,
follow these steps:

On the test machine:
.RS
.br
\- run the test
.br
\- run lcov \-c [\-d directory] \-\-to-package
.I file
.br
\- copy
.I file
to the build machine
.RE
.br

On the build machine:
.RS
.br
\- run lcov \-c \-\-from-package
.I file
[\-o and other options]
.RE
.br

This works for both kernel and user space coverage data. Note that you might
have to specify the path to the build directory using \-b with
either \-\-to\-package or \-\-from-package. Note also that the package data
must be converted to a .info file before recompiling the program or it will
become invalid.

Reset all execution counts to zero.

By default tries to reset kernel execution counts. Use the \-\-directory
option to reset all counters of a user space program.

Only one of  \-z, \-c, \-a, \-e, \-r, \-l, \-\-diff or \-\-summary may be
specified at a time.
