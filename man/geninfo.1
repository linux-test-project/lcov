.SH DESCRIPTION
.B geninfo 
converts all GCOV coverage data files found in 
.I directory
into tracefiles, which the
.B genhtml
tool can convert to HTML output.

Unless the \-\-output\-filename option is specified,
.B geninfo
writes its
output to one file per .da file, the name of which is generated by simply
appending ".info" to the respective .da file name.

Note that the current user needs write access to both
.I directory
as well as to the original source code location. This is necessary because
some temporary files have to be created there during the conversion process.

Note also that
.B geninfo
is called from within
.BR lcov ,
so that there is usually no need to call it directly.
.SH OPTIONS
.B \-h
.br
.B \-\-help
.RS
Print a short help text, then exit.
.RE

.B \-v
.br
.B \-\-version
.RS
Print version number, then exit.
.RE

.B \-q
.br
.B \-\-quiet
.RS
Do not print progress messages.

Suppresses all informational progress output. When this switch is enabled,
only error or warning messages are printed.
.RE

.B \-f
.br
.B \-\-follow
.RS
Follow links when searching .da files.
.RE

.BI "\-t " testname
.br
.BI "\-\-test\-name " testname
.RS
Use test case name 
.I testname
for resulting data. Valid test case names can consist of letters, decimal
digits and the underscore character ('_').

This proves useful when data from several test cases is merged (i.e. by
simply concatenating the respective tracefiles) in which case a test
name can be used to differentiate between data from each test case.
.RE

.BI "\-o " output\-filename
.br
.BI "\-\-output\-filename " output\-filename
.RS
Write all data to
.IR output\-filename .

If you want to have all data written to a single file (for easier
handling), use this option to specify the respective filename. By default,
one tracefile will be created for each processed .da file.

.RE
.B "\-\-no\-checksum"
.RS
Do not generate checksum data when writing tracefiles.
 
By default, each line of coverage data is associated with a checksum of the
corresponding source code line. This checksum is used to prevent merging
coverage data from incompatible source code versions. Use this option to
suppress generating such checksums for tracefiles.

This option can also be configured permanently using the configuration file
option
.IR geninfo_no_checksum .

.RE
.SH FILES

.I /etc/lcovrc
.RS
The systemwide configuration file.
.RE

.I ~/.lcovrc
.RS
The per-user configuration file.
.RE

Following is a quick description of the tracefile format as used by
.BR genhtml ", " geninfo " and " lcov .

A tracefile is made up of several human-readable lines of text,
divided into sections. If available, a tracefile begins with the
.I testname
which is stored in the following format:

  TN:<test name>

For each source file referenced in the .da file, there is a section containing
filename and coverage data:

  SF:<absolute path to the source file>

Following is a list of line numbers for each function name found in the
source file:

  FN:<line number of function start>,<function name>

Then there is a list of execution counts for each instrumented line
(i.e. a line which resulted in executable code):

  DA:<line number>,<execution count>[,<checksum>]

Note that there may be an optional checksum present for each instrumented
line. The current
.B geninfo
implementation uses an MD5 hash as checksumming algorithm.

At the end of a section, there is a summary about how many lines
were found and how many were actually instrumented:

  LH:<number of lines with a non-zero execution count>
  LF:<number of instrumented lines>

Each sections ends with:

  end_of_record

In addition to the main source code file there are sections for all
#included files which also contain executable code.

Note that the absolute path of a source file is generated by interpreting
the contents of the respective .bb file (see
.BR "gcov " (1)
for more information on this file type). Relative filenames are prefixed
with the directory in which the .bb file is found.

Note also that symbolic links to the .bb file will be resolved so that the
actual file path is used instead of the path to a link. This approach is
necessary for the mechanism to work with the /proc/gcov files.
