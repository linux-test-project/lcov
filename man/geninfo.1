.SH DESCRIPTION
.B geninfo
converts all GCOV coverage data files found in
.I directory
into tracefiles, which the
.B genhtml
tool can convert to HTML output.

Unless the \-\-output\-filename option is specified,
.B geninfo
writes its
output to one file per .da file, the name of which is generated by simply
appending ".info" to the respective .da file name.

Note that the current user needs write access to both
.I directory
as well as to the original source code location. This is necessary because
some temporary files have to be created there during the conversion process.

Note also that
.B geninfo
is called from within
.BR lcov ,
so that there is usually no need to call it directly.

.B Exclusion markers

To exclude specific lines of code from a tracefile, you can add exclusion
markers to the source code. Additionally you can exclude specific branches from
branch coverage without excluding the involved lines from line and function
coverage. Exclusion markers are keywords which can for example be added in the
form of a comment.
See
.BR lcovrc (5)
how to override some of them.

The following markers are recognized by geninfo:

LCOV_EXCL_LINE
.RS
Lines containing this marker will be excluded.
.br
.RE
LCOV_EXCL_START
.RS
Marks the beginning of an excluded section. The current line is part of this
section.
.br

LCOV_EXCL_STOP
.RS
Marks the end of an excluded section. The current line not part of this
section.
.RE
.br
LCOV_EXCL_BR_LINE
.RS
Lines containing this marker will be excluded from branch coverage.
.br
.RE
LCOV_EXCL_BR_START

.SH OPTIONS

.B \-b
.I directory
.br
.B \-\-base\-directory
.I directory
.br
.RS
.RI "Use " directory
as base directory for relative paths.

Use this option to specify the base directory of a build\-environment
when geninfo produces error messages like:

.RS
ERROR: could not read source file /home/user/project/subdir1/subdir2/subdir1/subdir2/file.c
.RE

In this example, use /home/user/project as base directory.

This option is required when using geninfo on projects built with libtool or
similar build environments that work with a base directory, i.e. environments,
where the current working directory when invoking the compiler is not the same
directory in which the source code file is located.

Note that this option will not work in environments where multiple base
directories are used. In that case use configuration file setting
.B geninfo_auto_base=1
(see
.BR lcovrc (5)).
.RE

.B \-\-branch\-coverage
.br
Collect retain branch coverage data.

This is equivalent to using the option "\-\-rc lcov_branch_coverage=1"; the option was added to better match the genhml interface.


.RE

.B \-\-checksum
.br
.B \-\-no\-checksum
.br
.RS
Specify whether to generate checksum data when writing tracefiles.

Use \-\-checksum to enable checksum generation or \-\-no\-checksum to
disable it. Checksum generation is
.B disabled
by default.

When checksum generation is enabled, a checksum will be generated for each
source code line and stored along with the coverage data. This checksum will
be used to prevent attempts to combine coverage data from different source
code versions.

If you don't work with different source code versions, disable this option
to speed up coverage data processing and to reduce the size of tracefiles.
.RE

.B \-\-compat
.IR mode = value [, mode = value ,...]
.br
.RS
Set compatibility mode.

Use \-\-compat to specify that geninfo should enable one or more compatibility
modes when capturing coverage data. You can provide a comma-separated list
of mode=value pairs to specify the values for multiple modes.

Valid
.I values
are:

.B on
.RS
Enable compatibility mode.
.RE
.B off
.RS
Disable compatibility mode.
.RE
.B auto
.RS
Apply auto-detection to determine if compatibility mode is required. Note that
auto-detection is not available for all compatibility modes.
.RE

If no value is specified, 'on' is assumed as default value.

Valid
.I modes
are:

.B libtool
.RS
Enable this mode if you are capturing coverage data for a project that
was built using the libtool mechanism. See also
\-\-compat\-libtool.

The default value for this setting is 'on'.

.RE
.B hammer
.RS
Enable this mode if you are capturing coverage data for a project that
was built using a version of GCC 3.3 that contains a modification
(hammer patch) of later GCC versions. You can identify a modified GCC 3.3
by checking the build directory of your project for files ending in the
extension '.bbg'. Unmodified versions of GCC 3.3 name these files '.bb'.

The default value for this setting is 'auto'.

.RE
.B split_crc
.RS
Enable this mode if you are capturing coverage data for a project that
was built using a version of GCC 4.6 that contains a modification
(split function checksums) of later GCC versions. Typical error messages
when running geninfo on coverage data produced by such GCC versions are
\'out of memory' and 'reached unexpected end of file'.

The default value for this setting is 'auto'
.RE

.RE

.B \-\-compat\-libtool
.br
.B \-\-no\-compat\-libtool
.br
.RS
Specify whether to enable libtool compatibility mode.

Use \-\-compat\-libtool to enable libtool compatibility mode or \-\-no\-compat\-libtool
to disable it. The libtool compatibility mode is
.B enabled
by default.

When libtool compatibility mode is enabled, geninfo will assume that the source
code relating to a .da file located in a directory named ".libs" can be
found in its parent directory.

If you have directories named ".libs" in your build environment but don't use
libtool, disable this option to prevent problems when capturing coverage data.
.RE

.B \-\-config\-file
.I config\-file
.br
.RS
Specify a configuration file to use.
See the lcovrc man page for details of the file format and options.

When this option is specified, neither the system\-wide configuration file
/etc/lcovrc, nor the per\-user configuration file ~/.lcovrc is read.

This option may be useful when there is a need to run several
instances of
.B geninfo
with different configuration file options in parallel.

Note that this option must be specified in full - abbreviations are not supported.

.RE

.B \-\-derive\-func\-data
.br
.RS
Calculate function coverage data from line coverage data.

Use this option to collect function coverage data, even if the version of the
gcov tool installed on the test system does not provide this data. lcov will
instead derive function coverage data from line coverage data and
information about which lines belong to a function.
.RE

.B \-\-external
.br
.B \-\-no\-external
.br
.RS
Specify whether to capture coverage data for external source files.

External source files are files which are not located in one of the directories
specified by \-\-directory or \-\-base\-directory. Use \-\-external to include
external source files while capturing coverage data or \-\-no\-external to
ignore this data.

Data for external source files is
.B included
by default.
.RE

.B \-f
.br
.B \-\-follow
.RS
Follow links when searching .da files.
.RE

.B \-\-gcov\-tool
.I tool
.br
.RS
Specify the location of the gcov tool.
.RE

.B \-h
.br
.B \-\-help
.RS
Print a short help text, then exit.
.RE

.B \-\-include
.I pattern
.br
.RS
Include source files matching
.IR pattern .

Use this switch if you want to include coverage data for only a particular set
of source files matching any of the given patterns. Multiple patterns can be
specified by using multiple
.B --include
command line switches. The
.I patterns
will be interpreted as shell wildcard patterns (note that they may need to be
escaped accordingly to prevent the shell from expanding them first).

See the lcov man page for details

.RE

.B \-\-exclude
.I pattern
.br
.RS
Exclude source files matching
.IR pattern .

Use this switch if you want to exclude coverage data from a  particular set
of source files matching any of the given patterns. Multiple patterns can be
specified by using multiple
.B --exclude
command line switches. The
.I patterns
will be interpreted as shell wildcard patterns (note that they may need to be
escaped accordingly to prevent the shell from expanding them first).
Note: The pattern must be specified to match the
.B absolute
path of each source file.

Can be combined with the
.B --include
command line switch. If a given file matches both the include pattern and the
exclude pattern, the exclude pattern will take precedence.

See the lcov man page for details.

.RE

.B \-\-substitute
.I regexp_pattern
.br
.RS
Apply Perl regexp
.IR regexp_pattern
to source file names found during processing.  This is useful when the path name reported by gcov does not match your source layout and the file is not found.See the lcov man page for more details.

.RE

.B \-\-omit\-lines
.I regexp
.br
.RS
Exclude coverage data from lines whose content matches
.IR regexp .

Use this switch if you want to exclude line and branch coverage data for some particular constructs in your code (e.g., some complicated macro).
See the lcov man page for details.

.RE

.B \-\-ignore\-errors
.I errors
.br
.RS
Specify a list of errors after which to continue processing.

Use this option to specify a list of one or more classes of errors after which
geninfo should continue processing instead of aborting.
Note that the tool will generate a warning (rather than a fatal error) unless you ignore the error two (or more) times:
.br
.RS
geninfo ... --ignore-errors unused,unused
.RE

.I errors
can be a comma\-separated list of the following keywords:

.B gcov:
the gcov tool returned with a non\-zero return code.

.B source:
the source code file for a data set could not be found.

.B unused
the include/exclude/substitute/omit pattern did not match any file pathnames.

.B parallel
various types of errors related to parallelism - e.g., child process died due to some error.  If you see an error related to parallel execution, it may be a good idea to remove the \-\-parallel flag and try again.

.B package
a required perl package is not installed on your system.  In some cases, it is possible to ignore this message and continue - however, certain features will be disabled in that case.

.B corrupt
corrupt/unreadable file found.

.RE
.BI "\-\-keep\-going "
.RS
Do not stop if error occurs: attempt to generate a result, however flawed.

This command line option corresponds to the
.I stop_on_error [0|1]
lcovrc option.   See the lcovrc man page for more details.

.RE

.BI "\-\-preserve "
.RS
Preserve intermediate data files (e.g., for debugging).

By default, intermediate files are deleted.

.RE
.BI "\-\-filter "
.I filters
.RS
Specify a list of coverpoint filters to apply to input data.
See the genhtml man page for details.

.B \-i
.br
.B \-\-initial
.RS
Capture initial zero coverage data.

Run geninfo with this option on the directories containing .bb, .bbg or .gcno
files before running any test case. The result is a "baseline" coverage data
file that contains zero coverage for every instrumented line and function.
Combine this data file (using lcov \-a) with coverage data files captured
after a test run to ensure that the percentage of total lines covered is
correct even when not all object code files were loaded during the test.

Note: currently, the \-\-initial option does not generate branch coverage
information.
.RE

.B \-\-no\-markers
.br
.RS
Use this option if you want to get coverage data without regard to exclusion
markers in the source code file.
.RE

.B \-\-no\-recursion
.br
.RS
Use this option if you want to get coverage data for the specified directory
only without processing subdirectories.
.RE

.BI "\-o " output\-filename
.br
.BI "\-\-output\-filename " output\-filename
.RS
Write all data to
.IR output\-filename .

If you want to have all data written to a single file (for easier
handling), use this option to specify the respective filename. By default,
one tracefile will be created for each processed .da file.
.RE

.B \-\-version\-script
.I script_file
.br
.RS
call script_file to find file ID from revision control when extracting data.
The ID is used for error checking when merging .info files.

The script will be called as:
.br
.I script_file source_file_name
;
.br
It should write the version ID to stdout and return a 0 exit status.
If the file has is not versioned, it should write an empty string and return a 0 exit status.  See the genhtml man page for more details.

.RE

.B \-v
.br
.B \-\-verbose
.RS
Increment informational message verbosity.  This is mainly used for script and/or flow debugging - e.g., to figure out which data file are found, where.
Also see the \-\-quiet flag.

Messages are sent to stdout unless there is no output file (i.e., if the coverage data is written to stdout rather than to a file) and to stderr otherwise.

.RE
.B \-q
.br
.B \-\-quiet
.RS
Decrement informational message verbosity.

Decreased verbosity will suppres 'progress' messages for example - while error and warning messages will continue to be printed.

.RE
.B \-\-debug
.RS
Increment 'debug messages' verbosity.  This is useful primarily to developers who want to enhance the lcov tool suite.

.RE

.BI "\-\-parallel "
.I [ integer ]
.br
.BI "\-j "
.I [ integer ]
.RS
Specify parallelism to use during processing (maximum number of forked child processes).  If the optional integer parallelism parameter is zero or is missing, then use to use up the number of cores on the machine.  Default is not to use a single process (no parallelism).

.RE
.BI "\-\-memory "
.I integer
.RS
Specify the maximum amount of memory to use during prallel processing, in Mb.  Effectively, the process will not fork() if this limit would be exceeded.  Default is 0 (zero) - which means that there is no limit.

This option may be useful if the compute farm environment imposes strict limits on resource utilization such that the job will be killed if it tries to use too many parallel children - but the user does now know a priori what the permissible maximum is.  This option enables the tool to use maximum parallelism - up to the limit imposed by the memory restriction.

.RE

.B \-\-rc
.IR keyword = value
.br
.RS
Override a configuration directive.

Use this option to specify a
.IR keyword = value
statement which overrides the corresponding configuration statement in
the lcovrc configuration file. You can specify this option more than once
to override multiple configuration statements.
See
.BR lcovrc (5)
for a list of available keywords and their meaning.
.RE

.BI "\-t " testname
.br
.BI "\-\-test\-name " testname
.RS
Use test case name
.I testname
for resulting data. Valid test case names can consist of letters, decimal
digits and the underscore character ('_').

This proves useful when data from several test cases is merged (i.e. by
simply concatenating the respective tracefiles) in which case a test
name can be used to differentiate between data from each test case.
.RE

.B \-\-version
.RS
Print version number, then exit.
.RE

.B \-\-tempdir
.I dirname
.br
.RS
Write temporary and intermediate data to indicated directory.  Default is "/tmp".
.RE

.SH FILES

.I /etc/lcovrc
.RS
The system\-wide configuration file.
.RE

.I ~/.lcovrc
.RS
The per\-user configuration file.
.RE

Following is a quick description of the tracefile format as used by
.BR genhtml ", " geninfo " and " lcov .

A tracefile is made up of several human\-readable lines of text,
divided into sections. If available, a tracefile begins with the
.I testname
which is stored in the following format:

  TN:<test name>

For each source file referenced in the .da file, there is a section containing
filename and coverage data:

  SF:<absolute path to the source file>

Following is a list of line numbers for each function name found in the
source file:

  FN:<line number of function start>,<function name>

Next, there is a list of execution counts for each instrumented function:

  FNDA:<execution count>,<function name>

This list is followed by two lines containing the number of functions found
and hit:

  FNF:<number of functions found>
  FNH:<number of function hit>

Branch coverage information is stored which one line per branch:

  BRDA:<line number>,<block number>,<branch number>,<taken>

Block number and branch number are gcc internal IDs for the branch. Taken is
either '-' if the basic block containing the branch was never executed or
a number indicating how often that branch was taken.

Branch coverage summaries are stored in two lines:

  BRF:<number of branches found>
  BRH:<number of branches hit>

Then there is a list of execution counts for each instrumented line
(i.e. a line which resulted in executable code):

  DA:<line number>,<execution count>[,<checksum>]

Note that there may be an optional checksum present for each instrumented
line. The current
.B geninfo
implementation uses an MD5 hash as checksumming algorithm.

At the end of a section, there is a summary about how many lines
were found and how many were actually instrumented:

  LH:<number of lines with a non\-zero execution count>
  LF:<number of instrumented lines>

Each sections ends with:

  end_of_record

In addition to the main source code file there are sections for all
#included files which also contain executable code.

Note that the absolute path of a source file is generated by interpreting
the contents of the respective .bb file (see
.BR "gcov " (1)
for more information on this file type). Relative filenames are prefixed
with the directory in which the .bb file is found.

Note also that symbolic links to the .bb file will be resolved so that the
actual file path is used instead of the path to a link. This approach is
necessary for the mechanism to work with the /proc/gcov files.
