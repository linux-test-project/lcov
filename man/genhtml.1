.RE
.SH DESCRIPTION

.B genhtml
creates an HTML view of coverage data found in tracefiles
.B geninfo
and
.B lcov
tools which are found from glob-match pattern(s)
.I tracefile_pattern.
See man
.B geninfo(1) for a description of the tracefile format.

 Features include:

.IP \(bu 3
Differential coverage comparison against baseline coverage data
.PP
.IP \(bu 3
Annotation of reports with date and owner information ("binning")
.PP

The basic concepts of differential coverage and date/owner binning are described in the paper found at
.I https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07947

.SS Differential coverage

Differential coverage compares two versions of source code - the baseline and the current versions - and the coverage results for each to segment the code into categories.
.br

To create a differential coverage report,
.B genhtml
requires

.IP 1. 3
one or more
.I baseline\-files
specified via
.BR \-\-baseline\-file ,
and
.PP
.IP 2. 3
a patch file in unified format specified using
.BR \-\-diff\-file .
.PP
.br

Both
.I tracefile_pattern
and
.I baseline\-file
are treated as glob patterns which match one or more files.
.br

The difference in coverage between the set of
.I tracefiles
and
.I baseline\-files
is classified line-by-line into categories based on changes in 2 aspects:

.IP 1. 3
.BR "Test coverage results" :
a line of code can be tested (1), untested (0),
or unused (#). An unused line is a source code line that has no associated
coverage data, for example due to a disabled #ifdef statement.
.br
.PP

.IP 2. 3
.BR "Source code changes" :
a line can be unchanged, added (+\ =>), or removed (=>\ \-).
Note that the diff-file format used by
.B genhtml
reports changes in lines as removal of old line and addition of new line.
.br
.PP

Below are the resulting 12 categories, sorted by priority (assuming that untested code is more interesting than tested code, and new code is more interesting than old code):
.br

.RE
.B UNC
.RS
Uncovered New Code (+ => 0): newly added code is not tested.
.br
.RE

.B LBC
.RS
Lost Baseline Coverage (1 => 0): unchanged code is no longer tested.
.br
.RE

.B UIC
.RS
Uncovered Included Code (# => 0): previously unused code is untested.
.br
.RE

.B UBC
.RS

.br

.B GBC

.br
.RE

.B GIC
.RS

.br
.RE

.B GNC
.RS
Gained New Coverage (+ => 1): newly added code is tested.
.br
.RE

.B CBC
.RS
Covered Baseline Code (1 => 1): unchanged code was tested before and is still tested.
.br
.RE

.B EUB
.RS
Excluded Uncovered Baseline (0 => #): previously untested code is unused now.
.br
.RE

.B ECB
.RS

.br
.RE

.B DUB
.RS
Deleted Uncovered Baseline (0 => \-): previously untested code has been deleted.
.br

Note: Because these lines are not represented in the current source version,
they are only represented in the classification summary table.
.RE

.B DCB
.RS
Deleted Covered Baseline (1 => \-): previously tested code has been deleted.
.br

Note: Because these lines are not represented in the current source version,
they are only represented in the classification summary table.
.br
.RE

The differential coverage report colorizes categorized regions in the source code view using unique colors for each.  You can use the
.B \-\-simplified\-colors
option to instead use one color for 'covered' code and another for 'uncovered'.

.SS Date and owner binning

.B "Date binning"
annotates coverage reports with age-of-last-change information to distinguish
recently added or modified code which has not been tested from older, presumed
stable code which is also not tested.
.B "Owner binning"
adds annotation identifying the author of changes.
.br

Both age and ownership reporting can be used to enhance team efforts to maintain
good coverage discipline by spotlighting coverage shortfalls in recently
modified code, even in the absence of baseline coverage data.
.br

To enable date and owner binning, the
.B \-\-annotate\-script
option must be used to specify a script that provides source code line age and
ownership information.
.br

For each source line, age is the interval since the most recent modification date
and the owner is the user identity responsible for the most recent change to that line.
.br

Line coverage overall totals and counts for each of the 12 classification categories are
collected for each of the specified age ranges (see the
.B \-\-date\-bins
option, below).

.SS Script conventions

Some
.B genhtml
options expect the name of an external script or tool as argument. These
scripts are then run as part of the associated function. This includes the
following options:

.RS
.B \-\-annotate\-script
.br
.B \-\-context\-script
.br
.B \-\-criteria\-script
.br
.B \-\-resolve\-script
.br
.B \-\-select\-script
.br
.B \-\-version\-script
.br
.RE

While each script performs a separate function there are some common aspects
in the way these options are handled:

.IP 1. 3
If the callback script name ends in
.B \.pm
then the script is assumed to be a Perl module.
.br
A perl module may offer performance advantages over an external script, as it is compiled once and loaded into the interpreter and because it can load and maintain internal state.
.br
The module is expected to export a method 'new', which is
called with the script name and the script parameters (if any) as arguments.  It is expected to return an object which implements several standard methods:
.br
.I $callback_obj = packagename\-\>new(perl_module_file, args);
.RS 3
.IP version\-script 3
.I $version = $callback_obj->extract_version($source_file_ename);
.br
.I $match = $callback_obj->check_version($old_version, $new_version, $source_file_name);
.br
.RS
.IP $match 3
 is expected to be 1 (true) if the version keys refer to the came file and 0 (false) otherwise.
.PP

.IP $version 3
 is a string representing a unique identifier of the particular version of the file
.PP
.RE

See example implementations
.I $LCOV_HOME/share/lcov/support-scripts/gitversion.pm
and
.I $LCOV_HOME/share/lcov/support-scripts/getp4version.pm.
.PP
.IP annotate\-script 3
.I ($status, $array) = $callback_obj->annotate($source_file_name);
.br
.br
.br

where
.RS
.IP $status 3
 is 0 if the command succeeded and nonzero otherwise.
.I $status
is interpreted in same way as the return code from 'system(..)'
.PP
.IP $array 3
is a list of line data of the form:
.br
.I [$text, $abbrev, $full_name, $when, $changelist].
.PP
.br

and

.IP $text 3
is the source text from the corresponding line (without newline termination)
.PP
.IP $abbrev 3
is the "abbreviated author name" responsible for this line of code.  This is the name that will be used in the various HTML tables.  For example, for brevity/readability, you may want to strip the domain from developers who are inside your organization.  If there is no associated author, then the value should be
.I \"NONE\".
.PP
.IP $full_name 3
is the "full author name" which is used in annotation tooltips.  See the
.I genhtml_annotate_tooltip
entry in man
.B lcovrc(5).
.I $fullname
may be
.I undef
if the full name and abbreviated names are the same.
.PP
.IP $when 3
is the timestamp associated with the most recent edit of the corresponding
line and may be
.I \"NONE\"
if there is no associated time.
.PP
.IP $changelist 3
is the commit identifier associated with the most recent change to this line, or
.I \"NONE\"
if there isn't one.
.PP


See example implementations
.I $LCOV_HOME/share/lcov/support-scripts/gitblame.pm
and
.I $LCOV_HOME/share/lcov/support-scripts/p4annotate.pm.
.RE

.IP context\-script
.I $hash = $callback_obj->context();
.br
.br

where
.I $hash
is a reference to a hash of key/value pairs which are meaningful to you.
This data is stored in the
.I profile
database.  See the 'profile' section in man
.B lcovrc(5)
for more information.

If your callback is not a perl module - for example, is a shellscript - then it should return a string such that the first word on each line is the key and the remainder is the associated data.  If a key is repeated, then the corresponding data strings are concatenated, separated by newline.

If you want to record only system information, then a shell callback is likely sufficient.  If you want to record any tool-specific/internal information, then you will need to implement a perl module so that your callback will be able to access the information.
Note that the constructor of your
.I context-script
callback (or of any callback) can perform any additional actions which
are required - for example, to write additional files, to query or set
tool-specific information,
.I etc.
For example, the example implementation, below, has an option to append
comments to the generated .info file.


See the example implementation
.I $LCOV_HOME/share/lcov/support-scripts/context.pm.
.RE



.IP criteria\-script
.I ($status, $array) = $callback_obj->check_criteria($obj_name, $type, $json);
.br
.br

where
.RS
.IP $obj_name 3
is the source file or directory name, or \"top\" of the object whose coverage criteria is being checked.
.PP
.IP $type 3
is the object type - either
.I \"file\", \"directory\", or \"top\".
.PP
.IP $json 3
is the coverage data associated with this object, in JSON format - see below.
.PP
.IP $status 3
is the return status of the operation, interpreted the same way as the
.I annotate
callback status, described above.
.PP
.IP $array 3
is a reference to a possibly empty list of strings which will be reported by genhtml.  The strings are are expected to explain why the coverage criteria failed.
.PP

See example implementations
.I $LCOV_HOME/share/lcov/support-scripts/criteria.pm.
.RE

.IP resolve\-script
$newpath = $callback_obj->resolve($source_file_name)
.br
.br

where
.I $newpath
is the correct path to the indicated source file or
.I undef
if the source file is not found by the callback.
.PP

.RE

.IP 2. 3
The option may be specified as a single
.I split_char
separated string which is divied into words (see
.B man lcovrc(5)
), or as a list of arguments.
The resulting command line is passed
to a shell interpreter to be executed.
The command line includes the script path followed by optional additional parameters
separated by spaces. Care must be taken to provide proper quoting if script
path or any parameter contains spaces or shell special characters.
.PP

.IP 3. 3
If an option is specified multiple times, then the parameters are
.I not
split, but are simply concatenated to form the command line - see the examples, below.
.br
For simplicity and ease of understanding:  your command line should
pass all arguments individually, or all as a comma-separated list - not a mix of the two.
.PP

.IP 4. 3
.B genhtml
passes any additional parameters specified via option arguments
between the script path and the parameters required by the script's function.
.br
.PP

Example:
.br

.RS
genhtml --annotate-script /bin/script.sh
.br
        --annotate-script arg0 ...
.br

results in the same callback as

.br
genhtml --annotate-script "/bin/script.sh arg0" ...
.br

or

.br
genhtml --annotate-script /bin/script.sh,arg0 ...
.br

Note that the first form is preferred.

.RE

The resulting
.B genhtml
callback executes the command line:
.br

.RS
/bin/script.sh arg0
.I source_file_name
.RE
.br

Similarly
.br
.RS
genhtml --annotate-script
.I /bin/myMoodule.pm
.br
        --annotate-script arg0 --annotate-script arg1 ...
.br

or
.br
genhtml --annotate-script
.I /bin/myMoodule.pm,arg0,arg1
.br

.br
.RE

result in
.B genhtml
executing
.br

.RS
$annotateCallback = myModule->new(arg0, arg1);
.RE

to initialize the class object -
.I arg0
and
.I arg1
passed as strings - and then to execute

.RS
($status, $arrayRef) = $annotateCallback(
.I source_file_name
);
.RE

to retrieve the annotation information.

In contrast, the command
.br
.RS
genhtml --annotate-script
.I /bin/myMoodule.pm
.br
        --annotate-script arg0,arg1 ...
.RE
would result in
.B genhtml
initializing the callback object via
.br

.RS
$annotateCallback = myModule->new("arg0,arg1");
.RE
where "arg0,arg1" is passed as single comma-separated string.

Similarly, the command
.br
.RS
genhtml --annotate-script
.I /bin/myMoodule.pm,arg0
.br
        --annotate-script arg1 ...
.RE
would very likely result in an error when genhtml tries to find
a script called "/bin/mymodule.pm,arg0".


Note that multiple instances of each script may execute simultaneously if the
.B \-\-parallel
option was specified. Therefore each script must either be reentrant or should arrange for its own synchronization, if necessary.
.br
In particular, if your callback is implemented via a perl module:
.IP \- 3
the class object associated with the module will initialized once (in the parent process)
.PP
.IP \- 3
The callback will occur in the child process (possibly simultaneously with other child processes).
.PP
As a result:  if your callback needs to pass data back to the parent, you will need to arrange a communication mechanism to do so.
.br

.SS Additional considerations

If the
.B \-\-criteria\-script
option is used, genhtml will use the referenced script to determine whether your coverage criteria have been met - and will return a non\-zero status and print a message if the criteria are not met.
.br

The
.B \-\-version\-script
option is used to verify that the same/compatible source code versions are displayed as were used to capture coverage data, as well as to verify that the same source code was used to capture coverage information which is going to be merged and to verify that the source version used for filtering operations is compatible with the version used to generate the data.

HTML output files are created in the current working directory unless the
.B \-\-output\-directory
option is used. If
.I tracefile
or
.I baseline\-file
ends with ".gz", it is assumed to be GZIP\-compressed and the gunzip tool
will be used to decompress it transparently.

Note that all source code files have to be present and readable at the
exact file system location they were compiled, and all path references in the input data ".info" and "diff" files must match exactly (i.e., exact string match).
.br

Further, the
.BR \-\-version\-script ", " \-\-annotate\-script ", and " \-\-criteria\-script " scripts "
use the same path strings. However, see the
.B \-\-substitute
and
.B \-\-resolve\-script
options for a mechanism to adjust extracted paths so they match your source and/or revision control layout.

.br
You can use the
.BR check_exisitence_before_callback
configuration option to tell the tool to check that the file exists before
calling the
.BR \-\-version\-script
or
.BR \-\-annotate\-script
callback. See man
.B lcovrc(5)
for details.
.br

.SS Additional options

Use option
.B \-\-diff\-file
to supply a unified diff file that represents the changes to the source
code files between the version used to compile and capture the baseline
trace files, and the version used to compile and capture the current
trace files.

Use option
.B \-\-css\-file
to modify layout and colors of the generated HTML output. Files are
marked in different colors depending on the associated coverage rate.
.br

By default, the coverage limits for low, medium and high coverage are set to
0\-75%, 75\-90% and 90\-100% percent respectively. To change these
values, use configuration file options.
.br

.RS
.IR genhtml_hi_limit " and " genhtml_med_limit

.br

or type-specific limits:
.br

.RS
.IR genhtml_line_hi_limit " and " genhtml_line_med_limit
.br
.IR genhtml_branch_hi_limit " and " genhtml_branch_med_limit
.br
.IR genhtml_function_hi_limit " and " genhtml_function_med_limit
.br
.RE

See man
.B lcovrc(5)
for details.

Also note that when displaying percentages, 0% and 100% are only printed when
the values are exactly 0% and 100% respectively. Other values which would
conventionally be rounded to 0% or 100% are instead printed as nearest
non\-boundary value. This behavior is in accordance with that of the
.BR gcov (1)
tool.

By default,
.B genhtml
reports will include both line and function coverage data.
Neither branch or MC/DC data is displayed by default; you can use the
.B \-\-branch\-coverage
and
.B \-\-mcdc\-coverage
options to enable branch or MC/DC coverage, respectively - or you can permanently enable branch coverage by adding the appropriate
settings to your personal, group, or site lcov configuration file.  See the
.B branch_coverage
and
.B mcdc_coverage
sections of man
.B lcovrc(5)
for details.


.SH OPTIONS

In general, (almost) all
.B genhtml
options can also be specified in your personal, group, project, or site
configuration file - see man
.B lcovrc(5)
for details.


.B \-h
.br
.B \-\-help
.RS
Print a short help text, then exit.

.RE
.B \-\-version
.RS
Print version number, then exit.

.RE
.B \-v
.br
.B \-\-verbose
.RS
Increment informational message verbosity.  This is mainly used for script and/or flow debugging - e.g., to figure out which data files are found, where.
Also see the \-\-quiet flag.

.RE
.B \-q
.br
.B \-\-quiet
.RS
Decrement informational message verbosity.

Decreased verbosity will suppress 'progress' messages for example - while error and warning messages will continue to be printed.

.RE
.B \-\-debug
.RS
Increment 'debug messages' verbosity.  This is useful primarily to developers who want to enhance the lcov tool suite.

.RE
.B \-\-validate
.RS
Check the generated HTML to verify that there are no dead hyperlinks and no unused files in the output directory.
The checks can also be enabled by setting environment variable
.B LCOV_VALIDATE = 1.
This option is primarily intended for use by developers who modify the HTML report.

.RE
.B \-\-flat
.br
.B \-\-hierarchical
.RS
Use the specified HTML report hierarchy layout.
.br

The default HTML report is 3 levels:

.RS 2
.IP 1. 3
.B top\-level:
table of all directories,
.PP

.IP 2. 3
.B directory:
table of source files in a directory, and
.PP

.IP 3. 3
.B source file detail:
annotated source code.
.PP
.RE

Option
.B \-\-hierarchical
produces a multilevel report which follows the directory structure of the
source code (similar to the file tool in Microsoft Windows).

Option
.B \-\-flat
produces a two-level HTML report:

.RS 2
.IP 1. 3
.B top\-level:
table of all project source files, and
.PP

.IP 2. 3
.B source file detail:
annotated source code.
.PP
.RE

The 'flat' view can reduce the number of clicks required to navigate around
the coverage report - but is unwieldy except for rather small projects consisting of only a few source files.  It can be useful in 'code review' mode, even for very large projects (see the
.I \-\-select\-script
option).
.br
Most large projects follow a rational directory structure - which favors the 'hierarchical' report format.  Teams responsible for a particular module can focus on a specific subdirectory or set of subdirectories.

Only one of options
.B \-\-flat
or
.B \-\-hierarchical
can be specified at the same time.

These options can also be persistently set via the lcovrc configuration file
using either:
.br

.RS
.I genhtml_hierarchical
= 1
.br
.RE

or
.br

.RS
.I genhtml_flat_view
= 1
.br
.RE

See man
.B lcovrc(5)
for details.

.RE
.B \-f
.br
.B \-\-frames
.RS
Use HTML frames for source code view.

If enabled, a frameset is created for each source code file, providing
an overview of the source code as a "clickable" image. Note that this
option will slow down output creation noticeably because each source
code character has to be inspected once. Note also that the GD.pm Perl
module has to be installed for this option to work (it may be obtained
from http://www.cpan.org).

This option can also be controlled from the
.I genhtml_frames
entry of the
.B lcovrc
file.

Use data in the files found from glob pattern
.I baseline\-file\-pattern
as coverage baseline.

.B \-\-baseline\-file
may be specified multiple times - for example, if you have multiple trace data files for each of several test suites and you do not want to go through the additional step of merging all of them into a single aggregated data file.

The coverage data files specified by
.I baseline\-file\-pattern
is read and used as the baseline for classifying the change in coverage represented by the coverage counts in
.IR tracefile\-patterns .
If
.I baseline\-file\-pattern
is a directory, then genhtml will search the directory for all files ending in '.info'.
See the
.I info_file_extension
section in
.B man(5) lcovrc
for how to change this pattern.

In general, you should specify a diff file in unified diff format via
.B \-\-diff\-file
when you specify a
.IR \-\-baseline\-file\-pattern .
Without a diff file, genhtml will assume that there are no source differences
between 'baseline' and 'current'.
For example:  this might be used to find
incremental changes caused by the addition of more testcases, or to compare
coverage results between gcc versions, or between gcc and llvm.

Note:

if filters are applied during the creation of a differential coverage report,

Best practice is to use a

It is almost always a better idea to filter at capture or aggregate time - not at report generation.

A suitable
.I \"universal diff\"
input file for the
.I \-\-diff\-file
option
can be generated using either the "p4udiff" or "gitdiff" sample scripts that are provided as part of this package, or by using revision control commands directly.

.RS

and

.RS

These scripts simply post\-process the 'p4' or 'git' output to (optionally) remove files that are not of interest and to explicitly note files which have not changed.

.B p4udiff
accepts either a changelist ID or the literal string "sandbox"; "sandbox" indicates that there are modified files which have not been checked in.
See "

It is useful to note unchanged files denoted by lines of the form:

.br

in the p4diff/gitdiff output as this knowledge will help to suppress spurious 'path mismatch' warnings.  See the
.B \-\-elide\-path\-mismatch
and
.B \-\-build\-directory
entries, below.

In general, you will specify
.B \-\-baseline\-file
when you specify
.BR \-\-diff\-file .
The
.I baseline_files
are used to compute coverage differences (
.I e.g.
gains and losses) between the baseline and current, where the
.I diff_file
is used to compute code changes:  source text is
identical between 'baseline' and 'current'.
If you specify
.I baseline_files
but no
.I diff_file,
the tool will assume that there are no code changes between baseline and current.
If you specify a
.I diff_file
but no
.I baseline_files,
the tool will assume that there is no baseline coverage data (no baseline code was covered); as result unchanged code (
.I i.e.,

.br

This option also instructs
.B genhtml
to add a summary table to the HTML report header that shows counts in the various coverage categories, associated with each date bin. In addition, each source code line will show age and owner information.
Annotation data is also used to populate a 'tooltip' which appears when the mouse
hovers over the associated source code.  See the
.I genhtml_annotate_tooltip
entry in man
.B lcovrc(5)
for details.
.br

The specified
.I script
is expected to obtain age and ownership information
for each source code line from the revision management system and to output
this information in the format described below.
.br

If the annotate script fails and annotation errors are ignored via
.BR --ignore-errors ,
then
.B genhtml
will try to load the source file normally.  If the file is not present or not readable, and the
.B \-\-synthesize\-missing
flag is specified, then
.B genhtml
will synthesize fake data for the file.
.br

.B genhtml
will emit an error if you have specified an annotation script but no files are
successfully annotated (see below).
This can happen, for example, if your P4USER, P4CLIENT,
or P4PORT environment variables are not set correctly -
.I e.g. if the
Jenkins user who generates coverage reports is not the same and the user
who checked out the code and owns the sandbox.

The sample script checks that top\-level line coverage meets the criteria "UNC + LBC + UIC == 0" (added code and newly activated code must be tested, and existing tested code must not become untested).
.br

As another example, it is possible to create scripts that mimic the

feature by checking that the ratio of exercised lines to total lines ("(GNC + GIC + CBC) / (GNC + GIC + CBC + UNC + UIC + UBC)") is greater than the threshold - either only at the top level, in every directory, or wherever desired. Similarly, criteria may include branch and function coverage metrics.
.br

By default the criteria script is called for all source code hierarchy levels, i.e.: top-level, directory, and file-level. The
.I criteria_callback_levels
configuration file option can be used to limit the hierarchy levels to any combination of 'top', 'directory', or 'file' levels.

Use

Use this option to specify an external tool or command line that
.B genhtml
can use to obtain a source code file's version ID when generating HTML or
applying source filters (see
.B \-\-filter

.br

A version ID can be a file hash or commit ID from revision control. It is used to check the version of the source file which is loaded against the version which was used to generate coverage data (i.e., the file version seen by lcov/geninfo). It is important that source code versions match - otherwise inconsistent or confusing results may be produced.
.br

Version mismatches typically happen when the tasks of capture, aggregation, and report generation are split between multiple jobs - e.g., when the same source code is used in multiple projects, a unified/global coverage report is required, and the projects accidentally use different revisions.
.br

If your .info (coverage data) file does not contain version information - for example, because it was generated by a tool which did not support versioning - then you can use the
.I compute_file_version " = 1"
config file option to generate the data afterward.  A convenient way to do this might be to use
.B lcov
.I \-\-add\-tracefile

.BI "\-\-show\-zero\-columns "
.RS
By default, columns whose entries are all zero are removed (not shown) in the summary table at the top of each HTML page.
If the
.B \-\-show\-zero\-columns
option is used, then those columns will be shown.

When columns are retained, then all the tables have the same width/contain the same number of columns - which may be a benefit in some situations.

When columns are removed, then the tables are more compact and easier to read.
This is especially true in relatively mature development environments, when there are very few un-exercised coverpoints in the project.

.RE
.BI "\-\-show\-navigation "

By default, the summary table in the source code detail view does not contain hyperlinks from the number to the first line in the corresponding category ('Hit' or 'Missed') and from the current location to the next location in the current category, in non-differential coverage reports.  (This is the lcov 'legacy' view non-differential reports.)

If the
.B \-\-show\-navigation

Hyperlinks are always generated for differential coverage reports.

This feature enables developers to find and understand coverage issues more quickly than they might otherwise, if they had to rely on scrolling.

See the

these hyperlinks in certain conditions.

Navigation hyperlinks are always enabled in differential coveage report.

Specify the maximum amount of memory to use during parallel processing, in Mb.  Effectively, the process will not fork() if this limit would be exceeded.  Default is 0 (zero) - which means that there is no limit.

This option may be useful if the compute farm environment imposes strict limits on resource utilization such that the job will be killed if it tries to use too many parallel children - but the user does not know a priori what the permissible maximum is.  This option enables the tool to use maximum parallelism - up to the limit imposed by the memory restriction.

The configuration file
.I memory_percentage
option provided another way to set the maximum memory consumption.
See man
.B lcovrc (5)
for details.


.RE
.BI \-\-filter " filters"
.RS
Specify a list of coverpoint filters to apply to input data.

Note that certain filters apply only to C/C++ source files.
.B genhtml
associates the file extension ('.c', '.vhd',
.I etc.
) with its source language.  See the
.I c_file_extentions
and
.I rtl_file_extensions
sections of man
.B lcovrc(5)
for a description of the default associations and how they can be changed.

Note that filters are applied to both 'branch' and 'MC/DC' coverpoints,
where appropriate: if a particular filter would remove some branch,
then it will also remove corresponding MC/DC coverpoints - for example,
.I "\-\-filter branch"
will remove MC/DC coverpoints if there is no conditional expression on the
corresponding line, and
.I "\-\-filter branch_region"
will remove both branch and MC/DC coverpoints in the marked region.

Most filters need the source code; filters are not applied if the source file is not available.  Similarly, for each source file, if the version recorded in the coverage data (the '.info' file)
does not match the version found on the filesystem, then a
.I version
error is reported.  If the
.I version
error is ignored, then filtering is not applied to the mismatched file.
See the
.I \-\-version\-script
for more information.

.I filters
can be a comma\-separated list of the following keywords:

.IP branch: 3
ignore branch counts for C/C++ source code lines which do not appear to contain conditionals.  These may be generated automatically by the compiler (e.g., from C++ exception handling) - and are not interesting to users.
This option has no effect unless
.B \-\-branch\-coverage
is used.

See also man
.B lcovrc(5)
- which describes several variables which affect branch filtering:
.I filter_lookahead
and
.I filter_bitwise_conditional.

The most common use for branch filtering is to remove compiler-generated branches related to C++ exception handlers.  See the no_exception_branch' option in man
.B lcovrc(5)
for a way to remove all identified exception branches.
.PP

.IP brace: 3
ignore line coverage counts on the closing brace of C/C++ code block, if the line contains only a closing brace and the preceding line has the same count or if the close brace has a zero count and either the preceding line has a non\-zero count, or the close brace is not the body of a conditional.

These lines seem to appear and disappear in gcov output - and cause differential coverage to report bogus LBC and/or GIC and/or UIC counts.  Bogus LBC or UIC counts are a problem because an automated regression which uses pass criteria "LBC + UIC + UNC == 0" will fail.
.PP

.IP blank: 3
ignore lines which contain only whitespace (or whitespace + comments) whose 'hit' count is zero.  These appear to be a 'gcov' artifact related to compiler-generated code - such as exception handlers and destructor calls at the end of scope - and can confuse differential coverage criteria.
.br
If lcovrc option
.I filter_blank_aggressive = 1
is enabled, then blank lines will be ignored whether their 'hit' count is zero or not.  Aggressive filtering may be useful in LLVM-generated coverage data, which tends to include large numbers of such lines.
.PP

.IP directive: 3
ignore lines which look like C compiler directives: #ifdef, #include, #define,
.I etc.
These lines are sometimes included by
.I llvm\-cov
when LLVM profile data is translated to LCOV format.
.PP

.IP exception: 3
Exclude branches related to C++ exception handling from branch coverage.
Whether C++ exception branches are identified and removed is dependent on your compiler/toolchain correctly marking them in the generated coverage data.
See the
.I no_exception_branch
section of
.B man lcovrc(5).

.IP initializer: 3
Exclude lines which appear to be part of a C++ std::initializer_list.
.PP

.IP line: 3
alias for "\-\-filter brace,blank".
.PP

.IP mcdc: 3
Remove MC/DC coverpoint which contains single expression, if 'branch' coverpoint
is present on the same line.
Singe-element MC/DC coverpoints are identical to the corresponding branch - except
in the case of compile-time expression evaluation, for example, in a template
function.

.IP orphan: 3
Remove branches which appear by themselves -
.I i.e.,
the branch has only one destination and so cannot be a conditional.
.br
These occur most frequently as a result of exception branch filtering.

.IP range: 3
Ignore line and branch coverpoints on lines which are out-of range/whose line number is beyond the end of the source file.  These appear to be gcov artifacts caused by a macro instantiation on the last line of the file.
.PP

.IP region: 3
apply LCOV_EXCL_START/LCOV_EXCL_STOP directives found in source text to the coverpoints found in the current and baseline .info files.
This option may be useful in cases that the source code was not found during 'lcov \-\-capture ...' but is accessible now.
.PP

.IP branch_region: 3
apply LCOV_EXCL_BR_START/LCOV_EXCL_BR_STOP directives found in source text to the coverpoints found in the current and baseline .info files.
This is similar to the 'region option, above - but applies to branch coverpoints only.
.PP

.IP function: 3
combine data for every "unique" function which is defined at the same file/line.
.I geninfo/gcov
seem to have a bug such that they create multiple entries for the same function.
This feature also merges all instances of the same template function/template method.
.PP

.IP trivial: 3
remove trivial functions and associated coverpoints.  'Trivial' functions are
whose body is empty/do not contain any statements.  Commonly, these include compiler-generated methods (e.g., default constructors and assignment operators) as well as static initialization wrappers, etc.

Note that the
.I trivial
filter requires function end line information - and so requires that you use a compiler version which is new enough to support begin/end line reports
(
.I e.g.,
gcc/9 or newer) or that you enable lcov/genhtml/geninfo to derive the information:

In man
.B lcovrc(5),
see the
.I derive_function_end_line
setting as well as the
.I trivial_function_threshold
setting.  The former is used to turn end line calculation on or off,
and the latter to change the lookahead used to determine whether the
function body is empty.
Also see the
.I lcov_filter_parallel
and
.I lcov_filter_chunk_size
settings, which may improve CPU performance if the number of files to process is very large.

.br
That is:  it evaluates the question:  does the result of the condition change if
.I this
constituent expression changed from true to false (termed the 'true' sense, above) or from false to true (termed the 'false' sens, above).
.br
For example, the expression
.I A || B
is sensitive to
.I A==true
when
.I B==false,
but is is not sensitive to
.I A==true
when
.I B==true.

.IP LLVM: 3
records the subexpression as covered if and only if there is a pair of evaluations
of the condition such that the condition was
sensitized for both 'true' and 'false' values of the subexpression.
This is defined as an
.I independence pair
in the LLVM documentation.
.PP

That is: the testcase must sensitize both values in order to be marked covered by
LLVM, whereas GCC will independently mark each.

This option will be removed in an upcoming release - so you should change your
scripts now.
.PP

.IP empty: 3
The patch file specified by the
.B \-\-diff\-file
argument does not contain any differences.  This may be OK if there were no source code changes between 'baseline' and 'current' (e.g., the only change was to modify a Makefile) - or may indicate an unsupported file format.
.PP

.IP excessive: 3
your coverage data contains a suspiciously large 'hit' count which is unlikely
to be correct - possibly indicating a bug in your toolchain.
See the
.I excessive_count_threshold
section in man
.B lcorc(5)
for details.
.PP

.IP fork: 3
Unable to create child process during
.I \-\-parallel
execution.
.br
If the message is ignored (
.I \-\-ignore\-errors fork
), then genhtml
will wait a brief period and then retry the failed execution.
.br
If you see continued errors, either turn off or reduce parallelism, set a memory limit, or find a larger server to run the task.

.PP

.IP format: 3
Unexpected syntax or value found in .info file - for example, negative number or
zero line number encountered.

.PP

.IP inconsistent: 3
This error indicates that your coverage data is internally inconsistent:  it makes two or more mutually exclusive claims.  For example:
.RS
.IP \- 3
Files have been moved or repository history presented by
.B \-\-diff\-file
data is not consistent with coverage data; for example, an 'inserted' line has baseline coverage data.  These issues are likely to be caused by inconsistent handling in the 'diff' data compared to the 'baseline' and 'current' coverage data (e.g., using different source versions to collect the data but incorrectly annotating those differences), or by inconsistent treatment in the 'annotate' script.
Consider using a
.B \-\-version\-script
to guard against version mismatches.
.PP
.IP \- 3
Two or more
.B gcov
data files or
.B lcov
".info" files report different end lines for the same function.  This is likely due either to a gcc/gcov bug or to a source version mismatch.
.br
In this context, if the
.I "inconsistent"
error is ignored, then the tool will record the largest number as the function end line.
.PP
.IP \- 3
Two or more
.B gcov
data files or
.B lcov
".info" files report different start lines for the same function.  This is likely due either to a gcc/gcov bug or to a source version mismatch.
.br
In this context, if the
.I "inconsistent"
error is ignored, then the tool will retain only the first function definition that it saw.
.PP
.IP \- 3
Mismatched function declaration/alias records encountered:
.RS 3
.IP "(backward compatible LCOV format)" 3
function execution count record (
.I FNDA
) without matching function declaration record (
.I FN

.PP
.IP "(enhanced LCOV format)" 3

.PP
.RE
.PP
.IP \- 3

.RE
.PP

.IP internal: 3
internal tool issue detected.  Please report this bug along with a testcase.
.PP

.IP mismatch: 3
Incorrect or inconsistent information found in coverage data and/or source code - for example,
the source code contains overlapping exclusion directives.

.PP

.IP missing: 3
remove all coverpoints associated with source files which are not found or are not readable.
This is equivalent to adding a
.I \-\-exclude <name>
pattern for each file which is not found.
.br
If a
.I \-\-resolve\-script
callback is specified, then the file is considered missing if it is not
locally visible and the callback
returns "" (empty string) or 'undef' - otherwise not missing.
.br

.IP negative: 3
negative 'hit' count found.

Note that negative counts may be caused by a known GCC bug - see

  https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=68080

and try compiling with "-fprofile-update=atomic". You will need to recompile, re-run your tests, and re-capture coverage data.
.PP


.IP package: 3
A required perl package is not installed on your system.  In some cases, it is possible to ignore this message and continue - however, certain features will be disabled in that case.
.PP

.IP parallel: 3
various types of errors related to parallelism -
.I i.e.,
a child process died due to an error.  The corresponding error message appears in the log file immediately before the
.I parallel
error.
If you see an error related to parallel execution that seems invalid, it may be a good idea to remove the \-\-parallel flag and try again.  If removing the flag leads to a different result, please report the issue (along with a testcase) so that the tool can be fixed.
.PP

.IP path: 3
File name found in
.B \-\-diff\-file
file but does not appear in either baseline or current trace data.  These may be mapping issues - different pathname in the tracefile vs. the diff file.
.PP

.IP range: 3
Coverage data refers to a line number which is larger than the number of
lines in the source file.  This can be caused by a version mismatch or
by an issue in the
.I gcov
data.
.PP

.IP source: 3
The source code file for a data set could not be found.
.PP

.IP unmapped: 3
Coverage data for a particular line cannot be found, possibly because the source code was not found, or because the line number mapping in the \.info file is wrong.

This can happen if the source file used in HTML generation is not the same as the file used to generate the coverage data - for example, lines have been added or removed.
.PP

.IP unsupported: 3
The requested feature is not supported for this tool configuration.  For example, function begin/end line range exclusions use some GCOV features that are not available in older GCC releases.
.PP

.IP unused: 3
The include/exclude/erase/substitute/omit pattern did not match any file pathnames.
.PP

.IP usage: 3
unsupported usage detected - e.g. an unsupported option combination.
.PP

.IP utility: 3
a tool called during processing returned an error code (e.g., 'find' encountered an unreadable directory).
.PP

.IP version: 3
\-\-version\-script comparison returned non\-zero mismatch indication.  It likely that the version of the file which was used in coverage data extraction is different than the source version which was found.  File annotations may be incorrect.
.PP

Note that certain error messages are caused by issues that you probably cannot
fix by yourself - for example, bugs in your tool chain which result in
.I inconsistent
coverage DB data (see above).
In those cases, after reviewing the messages you may want to exclude the offending code or the entire offending
file, or you may simply ignore the messages - either by converting to warning or suppressing entirely.
Another alternative is to tell
.B genhtml
about the number of messages you expect - so that it can warn you if something changes
such that the count differs, such that you know to review the messages again.
See the
.I "\-\-expect\-message\-count"
flag, below.

Also see 'man
.B lcovrc(5)
' for a discussion of the 'max_message_count' parameter which can be used to control the number of warnings which are emitted before all subsequent messages are suppressed.  This can be used to reduce log file volume.
.br

.RE
.BI "\-\-expect\-message\-count message_type:expr[,message_type:expr]"
.RS
Give
.B genhtml
a constraint on the number of messages of one or more types which are expected to
be produced during execution.  Note that the total includes _all_ messages
of the given type - including those which have been suppressed.
If the constraint is not true, an
error of type
.I "count"
(see above) is generated.
.I message_type
is one of the message mnemonics described above, and
.I expr
may be either
.IP \- 3
an integer - interpreted to mean that there should be exactly that number
of messages of the corresponding type, or
.IP \- 3
a Perl expression containing the substring
.B %C
; %C is replaced with the total number of messages of the corresponding type and
then evaluated.  The constraint is met if the result is non-zero and is not met
otherwise.

For example:
.IP
\-\-expect\-message\-count inconsistent:5
.br
says that we expect exactly 5 messages of type 'inconsistent'.
.PP
.IP
\-\-expect\-message\-count inconsistent:%C==5
.br
also says that we expect exactly 5 messages of this type, but specified
using expression syntax.
.PP
.IP
\-\-expect\-message\-count 'inconsistent : %C > 6 && %C <= 10'
.br
says that we expect the number of messages to be in the range (6:10].
(Note that quoting may be necessary, to protect whitespace from interpretation by
your shell, if you want to improve expression readability by adding spaces to your expression.)
.PP

Multiple constraints can be specified using a comma-separated list or
by using the option multiple times.

This flag is equivalent to the
.I "expect_message_count"
configuration option.  See man
.B lcovrc(5)
for more details on the expression syntax and how expressions are interpreted.
The number of messages of the particular type is substituted into the
expression before it is evaluated.

.RE

.BI "\-\-keep\-going "
.RS
Do not stop if error occurs: attempt to generate a result, however flawed.

This command line option corresponds to the
.I stop_on_error
lcovrc option.  See man
.B lcovrc(5)
for more details.

.RE

.B \-\-config\-file
.I config\-file
.br
.RS
Specify a configuration file to use.
See man
.B lcovrc(5)
for details of the file format and options.  Also see the
.I config_file
entry in the same man page for details on how to include one config file into
another.

When this option is specified, neither the system\-wide configuration file
/etc/lcovrc, nor the per\-user configuration file ~/.lcovrc is read.

This option may be useful when there is a need to run several
instances of
.B genhtml
with different configuration file options in parallel.

Note that this option must be specified in full - abbreviations are not supported.

.RE

.B \-\-profile
.I [ profile\-data\-file ]
.br
.RS
Tell the tool to keep track of performance and other configuration data.
If the optional
.I profile\-data\-file
is not specified, then the profile data is written to a file named
.I "genhtml.json"
in the output directory.

.RE


.B \-\-rc
.IR keyword = value
.br
.RS
Override a configuration directive.

Use this option to specify a
.IR keyword = value
statement which overrides the corresponding configuration statement in
the lcovrc configuration file. You can specify this option more than once
to override multiple configuration statements.
See man
.BR lcovrc (5)
for a list of available keywords and their meaning.
.RE

.BI "\-\-precision " num
.RS
Show coverage rates with
.I num
number of digits after the decimal point.

Default value is 1.

This option can also be configured permanently using the configuration file
option
.IR genhtml_precision .
.RE

.B \-\-merge\-aliases
.RS
Functions whose file/line is the same are considered to be aliases;
.B genthml
uses the shortest name in the list of aliases (fewest characters) as the leader.
.br
This option counts each alias group as a single object - so the 'function'
count will be the number of distinct function groups rather than the total number
of aliases of all functions - and displays them as groups in the 'function detail
table.
.br
Note that this option has an effect only if
.B "\-\-filter function"
has been applied to the coverage DB.
.br

This parameter an be configured via the configuration file
.IR merge_function_aliases
option.  See
.B man(5) lcovrc.


.B \-\-suppress\-aliases
.RS
Suppress list of aliases in function detail table.
.br

Functions whose file/line is the same are considered to be aliases;
.B genthml
uses the shortest name in the list of aliases (fewest characters) as the leader.
.br

The number of aliases can be large, for example due to instantiated templates - which can make function coverage results difficult to read.  This option removes the list of aliases, making it easier to focus on the overall function coverage number, which is likely more interesting.

Note that this option has an effect only if
.B "\-\-filter function"
has been applied to the coverage DB.

This parameter an be configured via the configuration file
.IR merge_function_aliases
option.  See
.B man(5) lcovrc.


.B \-\-forget\-test\-names
.br
.RS
If non\-zero, ignore testcase names in .info file -
.I i.e.,
treat all coverage data as if it came from the same testcase.
This may improve performance and reduce memory consumption if user does
not need per-testcase coverage summary in coverage reports.

This option can also be configured permanently using the configuration file
option
.IR forget_testcase_names .
.RE

.B \-\-missed
.RS
Show counts of missed lines, functions, branches, and MC/DC expressions.

Use this option to change overview pages to show the count of lines, functions,
branches, or MC/DC expressions that were not hit. These counts are represented by negative numbers.

When specified together with \-\-sort\-tables, file and directory views will be sorted
by missed counts.

This option can also be configured permanently using the configuration file
option
.IR genhtml_missed .
.RE

.B \-\-dark\-mode
.RS
Use a light\-display\-on\-dark\-background color scheme rather than the default dark\-display\-on\-light\-background.

The idea is to reduce eye strain due to viewing dark text on a bright screen - particularly at night.
.RE

.B \-\-tempdir
.I dirname
.br
.RS
Write temporary and intermediate data to indicated directory.  Default is "/tmp".
.RE

.BI "\-\-preserve "
.RS
Preserve intermediate data files generated by various steps in the tool - e.g., for debugging.  By default, these files are deleted.

.RE

.BI "\-\-save "
.RS
Copy
.I unified\-diff\-file, baseline_trace_files,

Keeping copies of the input data files may help to debug any issues or to regenerate report files later.

.RE

.B \-\-sort\-input
.br
.RS
Specify whether to sort file names before capture and/or aggregation.
Sorting reduces certain types of processing order-dependent output differences.
