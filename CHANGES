Version 1.2:
============

All:
- Added compatibility for gcc-3.3
- Adjusted LCOV-URL (http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php)
- Minor changes to whitespaces/line breaks/spelling
- Modified call mechanism so that parameters for external commands are not
  parsed by the shell mechanism anymore (no more problems with special
  characters in paths/filenames)
- Added checksumming mechanism: each tracefile now contains a checksum for
  each instrumented line to detect incompatible data

Makefile:
- Added rule to build source RPM
- Changed install path for executables (/usr/local/bin -> /usr/bin)

lcov.spec:
- Modified to support building source rpms

updateversion.pl:
- Modified to include update of release number in spec file

genhtml:
- Fixed bug which would not correctly associate data sets with an empty
  test name (only necessary when using --show-details in genhtml)
- Implemented new command line option '--nochecksum' to suppress generation
  of checksums
- Implemented new command line option '--highlight' which highlights lines of
  code which were only covered in converted tracefiles (see '--diff' option of
  lcov)

geninfo:
- Added workaround for a bug in gcov shipped with gcc-3.2 which aborts when
  encountering empty .da files
- Fixed geninfo so that it does not abort after encountering empty .bb files
- Added function to collect branch coverage data
- Added check for gcov tool
- Added check for the '--preserve-paths' option of gcov; if available, this
  will prevent losing .gcov files in some special cases (include files with
  same name in different subdirectories)
- Implemented new command line option '--follow' to control whether or not 
  links should be followed while searching for .da files.
- Implemented new command line option '--nochecksum' to suppress generation
  of checksums

lcov:
- Fixed bug which would not correctly associate data sets with an empty
  test name (only necessary when using --show-details in genhtml)
- Cleaned up internal command line option check
- Files are now processed in alphabetical order
- Added message when reading tracefiles
- Implemented new command line option '--nochecksum' to suppress generation
  of checksums
- Implemented new command line option '--diff' which allows converting
  coverage data from an older source code version by using a diff file
  to map line numbers
- Implemented new command line option '--follow' to control whether or not 
  links should be followed while searching for .da files.

genpng:
- Added support for the highlighting option of genhtml
- Corrected tab to spaces conversion
- Modified genpng to take number of spaces to use in place of tab as input
  instead of replacement string
  

Version 1.1:
============

- Added CHANGES file
- Added Makefile implementing the following targets:
  * install    : install LCOV scripts and man pages
  * uninstall  : revert previous installation
  * dist       : create lcov.tar.gz file and lcov.rpm file
  * clean      : clean up example directory, remove .tar and .rpm files
- Added man pages for all scripts
- Added example program to demonstrate the use of LCOV with a userspace
  application
- Implemented RPM build process
- New directory structure:
  * bin        : contains all executables
  * example    : contains a userspace example for LCOV
  * man        : contains man pages
  * rpm        : contains files required for the RPM build process
- LCOV-scripts are now in bin/
- Removed .pl-extension from LCOV-script files
- Renamed readme.txt to README

README:
- Adjusted mailing list address to ltp-coverage@lists.sourceforge.net
- Fixed incorrect parameter '--output-filename' in example LCOV call
- Removed tool descriptions and turned them into man pages
- Installation instructions now refer to RPM and tarball

descriptions.tests:
- Fixed some spelling errors

genhtml:
- Fixed bug which resulted in an error when trying to combine .info files
  containing data without a test name
- Fixed bug which would not correctly handle data files in directories
  with names containing some special characters ('+', etc.)
- Added check for empty tracefiles to prevent division-by-zeros
- Implemented new command line option --num-spaces / the number of spaces
  which replace a tab in source code view is now user defined
- Fixed tab expansion so that in source code view, a tab doesn't produce a
  fixed number of spaces, but as many spaces as are needed to advance to the
  next tab position
- Output directory is now created if it doesn't exist
- Renamed "overview page" to "directory view page"
- HTML output pages are now titled "LCOV" instead of "GCOV"
- Information messages are now printed to STDERR instead of STDOUT

geninfo:
- Fixed bug which would not allow .info files to be generated in directories
  with names containing some special characters
- Information messages are now printed to STDERR instead of STDOUT

lcov:
- Fixed bug which would cause lcov to fail when the tool is installed in
  a path with a name containing some special characters
- Implemented new command line option '--add-tracefile' which allows the
  combination of data from several tracefiles
- Implemented new command line option '--list' which lists the contents
  of a tracefile
- Implemented new command line option '--extract' which allows extracting
  data for a particular set of files from a tracefile
- Implemented new command line option '--remove' which allows removing
  data for a particular set of files from a tracefile
- Renamed '--reset' to '--zerocounters' to avoid a naming ambiguity with
  '--remove'
- Changed name of gcov kernel directory from /proc/gcov to a global constant
  so that it may be changed easily when required in future versions
- Information messages are now printed to STDERR instead of STDOUT
