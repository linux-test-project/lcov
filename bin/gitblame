# gitblame [domain]
#
#   This script runs "git blame" for the specified file and formats the result
#   to match the diffcov(1) age/ownership annotation specification.
#
# By default, it strips the domain from each author's email address.
# If passed a domain name (or domain regexp) - then it strips that domain
# from the author's address, and treats all users outside the matching domain
# as "External".
