# getp4version

#   This is a sample script which uses perforce commands to determine
#   the version of the filename passed in.
#   Version information (if present) is used during ".info" file merging
#   to verify that the data the user is attempting to merge is for the same
#   source code/same version.
#   If the version is not the same - then line numbers, etc. may be different
#   and soem very strange errors may occur.
